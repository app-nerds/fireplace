# Fireplace

![Fire Pit](../../assets/fire-pit.jpg)

Fireplace is a set of tools for capturing and viewing structured log entries
from your applications. Currently it is specifically tailored to log entries
coming from Go applications using [https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus](Logrus)
for logging. Fireplace provides a hook which will automatically send logs
to Fireplace Server and capture them into a MongoDB database. Fireplace
Viewer can then be used to sort through logs using a web UI.

### Notice
This project is hardly ready for prime-time, and I only really put it together
for my own personal use. But it is MIT licensed so if you want to use it,
go for it!

## Getting Started
Fireplace Server is a Go application that runs an HTTP server for capturing
and serving up structured log entries. Fireplace Viewer is a web application
used to view these captured logs.

To begin, ensure you have [Go 1.16+](https://golang.org/dl/) installed. To compile
the server application, perform the following on the terminal.

```
git git@github.com:app-nerds/fireplace.git
cd fireplace/cmd/fireplace-server
go get
go build
cd ../fireplace-viewer 
go get
go generate
go build
```

## Server Flags
The following are command line arguments that can be used to customize how the Fireplace Server
runs.

* **host** - IP/Port to bind to. Defaults to *0.0.0.0:8999*
* **loglevel** - What level to write logs at. Defaults to *info*

### Example
```
$ ./fireplace-server -host=127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Capturing Logs in a Go Application
To capture logs in your Go applications using Logurs and Fireplace, ensure you are importing
Logrus and the Fireplace hook. Here is a small sample of logging to Fireplace Server.

```
package main

import (
    fireplacehook "github.com/app-nerds/fireplace/cmd/fireplace-hook"
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    logger := logrus.New()
    logger.AddHook(fireplacehook.NewFireplaceHook(&fireplacehook.FireplaceHookConfig{
        Application: "Sample Application",
        FireplaceURL: "http://localhost:8999"
    }))

    logger.WithField("someKey", "someValue").Infof("This is a log entry!")
}
```

## Fireplace Server API

### Capturing A Log Entry
This is the main function of Fireplace Server. Application call this endpoint
to capture log entries into the database.

#### POST: /logentry

#### Payload
A log entry consists of a body in JSON format, with a content type of **application/json**.
The body must look something like this.

```json
{
   "application": "My Application",
   "details": [
      {
         "key": "useful",
         "value": "value"
      }
   ],
   "level": "info",
   "message": "My log message!",
   "time": "2018-07-04T09:39:05Z07:00"
}
```

The payload must be configured in this way. The *details* key can be an
empty array, and not required to contain any values. This key is used
to provide arbitrary key/value pairs of additional data.

*level* must be one of the following:

* debug
* warning
* info
* error
* fatal
* panic

#### Response
Upon successful capture a *200* status code and the new log entry
**ID** will be returned.

### Getting Captured Log Entries

#### GET: /logentry

#### Query Parameters
* **page** - Page number of records to retrieve. 1-based. *Required*
* **application** - Filter results by application name. *Optional*
* **level** - Filter results by level of severity. Must be one of the following: *debug*, *warning*, *info*, *error*, *fatal*, *panic*. *Optional*
* **search** - Filter results by a search term. This will apply against the log message. *Optional*

#### Response
Upon return the payload will return a structure which contains the total count of records, the number of records in this
response, the size of a page, and the collection of matching log entries. Here is a sample.

```json
{
   "count": 10,
   "logEntries": [
      {
         "application": "Create Test Entries 1",
         "details": [
            {
               "key": "additional",
               "value": "Additional 1"
            },
            {
               "key": "who",
               "value": "Main Process"
            }
         ],
         "id": "5b3cde7a85db9e2b16aa4aae",
         "level": "info",
         "message": "This is test message 1",
         "time": "2018-07-04T09:49:30-05:00"
      },
      {
         "application": "Create Test Entries 1",
         "details": [
            {
               "key": "additional",
               "value": "Additional 3"
            },
            {
               "key": "who",
               "value": "Main Process"
            }
         ],
         "id": "5b3cde7a85db9e2b16aa4ab2",
         "level": "error",
         "message": "This is error 1",
         "time": "2018-07-04T09:49:30-05:00"
      }
  ],
   "pageSize": 100,
   "totalCount": 10
}
```

### Getting a Single Log Entry

#### GET: /logentry/:id

#### Path Parameters
* **id** - ID of the log entry to retrieve

#### Response
Upon return the payload will return a structure which contains the specified log entry. Here is a sample:

```json
{
    "application": "Create Test Entries 1",
    "details": [
    {
        "key": "additional",
        "value": "Additional 1"
    },
    {
        "key": "who",
        "value": "Main Process"
    }
    ],
    "id": "5b3cde7a85db9e2b16aa4aae",
    "level": "info",
    "message": "This is test message 1",
    "time": "2018-07-04T09:49:30-05:00"

### Getting Application Names
Retrieve a list of application names captured in log entries. When an application
writes a log entry to Fireplace Server it provides an application name. This
endpoint returns a list of those names.

#### GET: /applicationname

#### Response
An array of application names.

```
[
    "application name 1",
    "application name 2"
